# cosc6340-Project-2

You will develop a small DBMS in C++ supporting SQL with nested SPJ queries. The small DBMS will require you to use binary files for efficient processing. You will have to submit this program in two phases. You are expected to fix the bugs or missing functionaly from the previous phase. If you have doubts about how an SQL statement should work try it on a commercial DBMS. If you want to implement extra SQL functionality, especially related to complex query optimization feel free to send email.
